Namespaces -> eg ->

1 - login -> getTicket()
2 - signup -> getTicket()

program -> 

{
    getTicket();
    getTicket();
}

Program is confused, which one I have to use and crash [to resolve this -> NAMESPACE]

{
    signup::getTicket()
    login::getTicket()
}

Now, he knows what to use when !

_ at start means private 
__ means system keyword
71 reserved keyword
