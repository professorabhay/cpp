4 Types-> 

1- Iterators  -> Loop them like vectors [input, output, forward]
2- Functors   -> manage state, parameterized [pointer, constructor]
3- Algorithms -> Search,  Sort
4- Containers -> Implementations of well defined data structure
        sequence types - Vector, list, deques, stacks, queues
        associative type - Set, multisets, maps, multimaps (binary trees)
            unordered associative types - Set, multisets, maps, multimaps (hash maps)
